## PyZX Heuristixz

- This is a clone from the [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx) library with additional heuristic-based diagram simplification.
- For a demonstration run [this](demos/heuristic_demos/basic_demo.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
- Benchmark circuits optimized via heuristic-based simplification can be found [here](evaluation/feyn_bench/after/).
- Benchmark circuits optimized via Nam et al. combined with our heuristic-based simplification can be found [here](evaluation/nam_bench/after/).
