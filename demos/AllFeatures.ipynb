    "To get around this issue PyZX offers the *phase teleportation* routine. This uses the diagrammatic simplification only as information to inform when phase gates can be combined in the original circuit, but otherwise it leaves the circuit intact. The details can be found in [Reducing T-count with the ZX-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10477)."
